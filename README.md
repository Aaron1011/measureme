# measureme [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rust-lang/measureme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rust-lang/measureme)
Support crate for rustc's self-profiling feature

This crate is maintained by the Rust compiler team and in particular by the
[self-profile working group][wg-self-profile]. It is currently only meant to
be used within rustc itself, so APIs may change at any moment.
